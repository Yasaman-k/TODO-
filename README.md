# todo-app

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### run server 
```
yarn server
```

### What I used
- composition api
- ref
- json-server to save data in json files and Fake REST API

### Challenges
- automaticlly refresh page when crud data

### What I learned
- difference between a tag and router-link , when you redirect to another page by a link it automatically refresh last page that you were in it! it actuallt refetch everything/ router-link is usefull for interna link and a tag for external links.
